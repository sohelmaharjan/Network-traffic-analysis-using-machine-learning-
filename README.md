# Network-traffic-analysis-using-machine-learning-

This project aims to use machine learning techniques to analyze and classify the network traffic into different software defined traffic such as Ping, DNS, Telnet and Voice. The data used will consist of various details on traffic flow and it will be automatically generated using network emulation software. The resultant machine learning model is expected to classify network traffics with good accuracy and precision.  
The objectives of this project are pointed out below: 
  
●	Collection of automatically generated data using network simulation software for different network traffic types used in this project (Ping, DNS, Telnet and Voice).  
● Using Python 3 language while utilizing various Python packages like Sklearn, Pandas and Numpy for machine learning tasks and Matplotlib for visualization of data

●	Build machine learning models based on both Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning techniques i.e Logistic Regression and K-Means Clustering .
●	Test out the built machine learning models based on the data generated by the network simulation software used.  
●	Evaluate and make any changes necessary in the current model regarding optimization and performance.  
●	Evaluate the models on real-time data generated between machines and test the models based on the results
